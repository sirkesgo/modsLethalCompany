# CoilHeadStare - made by TDP

This mod makes the Coil Head slowly turn its head to stare at you after standing close to it for a while. Because it just isn't scary enough already.

*You are looking right at it. It shouldn't be able to move, right? Slowly, its head begins to turn towards you, menacingly. Mocking you. It knows you can't escape.*

This is a client-mod, anyone who has it installed will see the Coil Head stare at the closest player.

Values like the speed at which the head turns are tweakable in the config file.

**Extra feature:** If you hit the Coil Head with a shovel or something similar, the head spring will bounce. This is on by default but can be changed in the config file.

**Important: This mod is incompatible with many model replacements or reskins of the Coil Head.**

But even if the head doesn't turn, hitting it with a shovel for the recoil animation should almost always work.

&nbsp;

To modders: If you want to make your reskin work with CoilHeadStare:
- Make sure to have the head and body mesh seperate, and have the head as a child transform of "springBone.002".
- The transform hierarchy does not have to be the exact same as the default Coil Head, but this mod does a recursive search for a transform with the name "springBone.002", and its last child is expected to be the head.
- If there are multiple "springBone.002", perhaps because the original hierarchy is not deleted, the last one the recursive search finds is used.
- If you use the default rig, there is another animated bone as child of "springBone.002". The head needs to be behind that in the hierarchy.
- The head needs to have a MeshRenderer, not a SkinnedMeshRenderer.
- Make sure the head transform origin / pivot point is at the neck, where you would expect it to turn.
- Lastly, if the Z axis of your head is not pointing forward, make it the child of an empty gameobject at the same position which points forward.

There does seem to be a way to not have the head seperate but instead entirely weighted to the single bone under springBone.002, however if this works in all cases is uncertain.
