## What is Diversity?
Diversity is a mod that revamps few aspects of the game. Generally the entities itself.

## What changed?
### This is what Diversity revamps:
- Spiders
- Crawlers
- Bracken
- Centipede
- Dress girl
- ~~The players~~
- Many more aspects of the game to makes things more scary and interesting!

### This is what Diversity adds:
- The Walker (New ennemy)
- The Watcher (New ennemy)
- New rooms (Dedicated to the enemies)

## The Spiders & Crawlers
- Added brief slow with a few seconds cooldown to the Spiders and Crawlers when hitting them. (This was added to balance the rail cheese fix.)

## The Bracken
- The Bracken will now stay true to his darkness. He will flicker and turn off all nearby lights and will dim player's flashlights if they're close to the Bracken.
- The lights turned off by the Bracken will naturally turn back on after a minute or 2.
- Trying to forcibly turn back on the lights with the breaker box could cause the Bracken to be angered for a while and causes fear. The power also becomes shut off permanently.
- The Bracken will turn off all nearby radar boosters.
- The Bracken will turn off the breaker box occasionally.
- Taking the apparatus will now immediately anger the Bracken, chasing the player who angered the Bracken.
- The Bracken now has a personal space.

## The Dress girl
- She will haunt your walkie-talkie.
- She now has the ability to isolate you and to give you hallucinations.
- She has new voice lines.

## The Centipedes
- You can now help your friends out whenever a centipede is latched onto their head by spamming the use button if you don't have a shovel. 
- Trying to help free a centipede from a player's head could hurt you.

## The Players
- ~~Players will receive conditions such as broken leg, broken arm, bleeding, blindness, and concussions.~~ (Now a standalone mod that can be found [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IntegrityChaos/Frailty/))
- ~~Players will have true darkness when there are no lights inside, it is recommended to bring a flashlight.~~ (Now a standalone mod that can be found [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IntegrityChaos/Full_Darkness/))
