# Atlas Abyss [1.2.3 Release]
![Screenshot_1](https://i.imgur.com/CKuPAi9.png "1")  

A moon of dark secrets, jagged terrain and carved stone. Below the surface, the Masked Men have broken free. The abyss below extends *redacted* metres and none have survived the fall.

# This moon now uses Lethal Level Loader

This moon is designed as a moon to go to if you don't make enough quota for titan, giving more scrap than rend but harder enemies.
The moon has similar scrap to rend but is cheaper and harder difficulty. Current enemy spawns and scrap are new and subject to change, you can help shape the spawn rates in discord. (see the feedback section)

Route name ```Atlas Abyss```.
Route cost: ```200```.
The moon also comes with a custom config to change the route price to your desire.

The internal moon name is ```Atlas Abyss```. Any custom dungeons using ***Lethal Level Loader*** should work in multiplayer.
If you also have Lethal Expansion installed it is recommended you use Lethal Expansion Core to avoid any issues with compatibility.
